# AI Disclaimer for Listopia

Listopia integrates an AI-powered chat feature that enables users to control the application and manage lists using natural language. This enhances the collaborative and intuitive experience of Listopia, built on Ruby on Rails 8. However, users should be aware of the following limitations and risks associated with the AI chat feature.

## Limitations and Risks

- **Potential for Inaccurate Information**: The AI may occasionally generate responses that are incorrect, incomplete, or misleading (commonly referred to as "hallucinations"). Users should verify critical information, such as task details or instructions, against reliable sources or Listopia's core functionality.
- **Not a Substitute for Professional Advice**: The AI is not designed to provide professional, legal, financial, or other specialized advice. Always consult qualified professionals for such matters.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI's responses are based on patterns and data it has been trained on and may not fully grasp nuanced or project-specific contexts, such as complex list management scenarios.
- **Open-Source Nature**: As an open-source project under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, the AI's performance relies on community contributions and updates. We encourage users to help improve the system by reporting issues or contributing.

## Recommendations for Users

- **Stay Updated**: Check [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for updates on the AI feature and other project developments, as community contributions may improve accuracy and reliability over time.
